# Rock Paper Scissor game

This is a fun game! There are three options you can choose from - Rock or Paper or Scissor. We have used random mathed to assign computer an option out of above three to play with you.

Here is thumb rule :-
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

There are going to be five rounds in each play and the best of five wins. Simple! 

All the best, hope you'll enjoy this game.
